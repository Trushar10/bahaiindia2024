        <p>
            Throughout the world, in cities, villages and towns,
            millions of Bahá’ís are striving to build communities that
            are spiritually and materially prosperous. Joining hands
            with all those who yearn to build a better world, they are
            laboring to lay the foundations of a new civilization
            through activities and programs centred on worship and
            service. For the followers of the Bahá’í Faith, which is the
            youngest world religion, these efforts are part of a vast
            global undertaking whose overarching purpose is the
            spiritual and the material unification of the human race.
        </p>
        <p>
            In India, Bahá’ís hail from every conceivable background –
            from the jungles of the Andamans to the high rises of
            Mumbai, from the coastline of Tamil Nadu to the mountainous
            regions of Sikkim. Through opening their homes for
            gatherings for collective worship, for classes for the
            spiritual education of children, adolescents and adults,
            they are collaborating with the inhabitants of their
            localities in diverse settings to weave a pattern of
            community life characterized by unity, justice and devotion
            to the common good.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the vast, ancient and diverse nation of India courses its
            way majestically into the twenty first century, new horizons
            open before it. The opportunities and challenges that this
            future brings demands of individuals, institutions and
            communities new levels of spiritual maturity and
            intellectual capacity to thrive in a complex, highly
            interconnected world.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Bahá’í community of India is deeply committed to the
            processes of capacity building and learning that would equip
            the country’s masses with the spiritual insights and the
            scientific outlook needed to build a world based on justice
            and oneness.

                <h3>Religion Renewed</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout history, God revealed Himself to humanity
                    through a series of Divine Messengers. Baha’u’llah
                    is the latest of these Messengers who has brought
                    spiritual and social teachings for our modern age.

                <h3>Community Building</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout India, individuals from all backgrounds
                    and in diverse settings are laying the foundations
                    of communities that are spiritually and materially
                    prosperous. They strive to serve the common good
                    through activities that revolve around the axis of
                    worship and service.

                <h3>House of Worship</h3>
                <p>
                    The Baha’i House of Worship brings together two
                    interrelated aspects of community life - worship and
                    service. The House of Worship symbolizes the oneness
                    of religion and and the idea that the teachings of
                    the Messengers or Avataars of God are all ultimately
                    doors to one reality.
